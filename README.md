Web Development Journey
This repository contains my day-wise learning progress in Web Development.
I am pushing all my practice files, exercises, and small projects to track my growth step by step.

Whatâ€™s inside?
-HTML basics (tags, structure, forms, links)
-CSS styling (colors, fonts, layouts, positioning)
-JavaScript (coming soon as I progress)
-Future topics: Responsive design, Bootstrap, React, Node.js, and more.

Purpose
This repo is my learning tracker and practice space for web development. By the end of this journey, I aim to have a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development.
